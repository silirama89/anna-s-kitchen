      <h3>Anna Goodwin</h3>
      <h2>Owner and Chef at Anna's Kitchen</h2>
      <p>When I was nine my sister took me shopping because I wanted to make dinner for my parents and eight siblings. Between the success of those tacos and shortly thereafter confessing my love of doing dishes, I have spent most of my time in kitchens. Not a minute of it has been wasted.</p>
      <p>In high school, some big family changes gave me the opportunity to officially take over the shopping and kitchen. Largely self-taught but with a wealth of experience, I began a small wedding cake business, keeping this up until I moved to Ann Arbor, MI, and, as a Dominican novice, spent 3 years helping cook for 100 sisters at the mother house. When I came home, hungry for an official kitchen job, I drove to Fiore Market Cafe in South Pasadena to tell Bill I should be his baker.</p> 
      <p>All I have received from him and from my family, and religious formation compel me to use my expertise to nourish others, which is why I’m launching Anna’s Kitchen. My hope is to bring the joy of comfortable, intimate, and professional family dinner parties to the homes of others.</p>
